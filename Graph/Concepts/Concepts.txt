-- Graph | Theory
1. Graph is a data structure that stores connected data.
2. Vertex/Node
3. Edge
4. Directed Graph | All the edges are directed.
5. UnDirected Graph
6. Cyclic | Acyclic Graphs
7. Path | Contains a lot of nodes & each of them are reachable.
8. Degree(x) | Undirected Graph | The number of nodes goes or come through that x node. || No. of Degree = 2 * No. of Edges | Because every edge connected with two nodes.
9. Directed Graph | InDegree & OutDegree | Indegree- No of incoming edges on that node | outDegree- No of outgoing edges from that node.
10. Edge-weight | if weight didn't provided means it's unit edge. |


Notes: A Node cannot appear twice in a path.
